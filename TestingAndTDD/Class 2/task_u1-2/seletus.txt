Here's a breakdown of the simplified code step by step:

Function Definition: process_data(input_file, output_file)

This function takes two arguments: input_file, the name of the file containing participant data, and output_file, the name of the file where processed data will be written.

Initializing grade_data Dictionary:

Inside the function, we create an empty dictionary called grade_data. This dictionary will store information about each grade, including the number of participants and the total distance covered.
Reading Input File:

The function opens the input file (input_file) in read mode ('r') using a context manager (with open(input_file, 'r') as f:).
It reads the first line of the file to determine the number of participants (num_participants).

Processing Participant Data:

It then iterates over each participant using a loop (for _ in range(num_participants)).
Inside the loop, it reads a line from the file, splits it into separate values, and assigns them to variables grade, step_length, and step_counts.
It checks if all elements in step_counts are non-zero (using all(step_counts)). If they are, it proceeds with further calculations.

Calculating Total Distance:

It calculates the total distance covered by the participant by multiplying step_length with the sum of step_counts, then dividing by 100000.0 to convert from centimeters to kilometers.

Updating grade_data Dictionary:

It updates the grade_data dictionary for the respective grade.
If the grade already exists in grade_data, it increments the number of entries ('entries') and adds the calculated total distance ('distance') to the existing values.
If the grade is encountered for the first time, it initializes its entry in the dictionary with values for entries and distance, and then updates them.

Writing to Output File:

After processing all participants, it opens the output file (output_file) in write mode ('w') using a context manager.
It iterates over the grade_data dictionary and writes the grade, number of entries, and total distance (formatted to two decimal places) to the output file.
Each grade's data is written in a separate line.

Function Call:

Finally, the function process_data is called with the input file "u1.txt" and output file "u1result.txt".
This code essentially reads data from an input file, calculates the total distance covered by participants of different grades, and writes the summarized data to an output file.
